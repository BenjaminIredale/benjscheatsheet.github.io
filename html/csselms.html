                            and which in the back, when more than one overlap. The element
                            with the highest z-index integer will be further forward.

                        <td>This property assignbs the 'render block' of an element. The 
                            three most common values for this property are &lt;block&gt;, 
                            &lt;inline&gt;, and &gt;inline-block&lt;. 
                            <em>Block-level</em> elements take up the full width of their container
                            with line breaks before and after, and can have their height and width
                            dimensions adjusted manually.
                            <em>Inline</em> elements take up as little space as possible, flow
                            horizontally, and cannot have their width or height manually adjusted.
                            <em>Inline-block</em> elements can appear next to each other, AND can
                            have their width and height manually adjusted.</td>

                        <td>The default positioning for an element is &lt;static&gt;. However, this property
                            can be assigned different values. When the CSS position for an HTML element is 
                            set to &lt;position: fixed&gt;, it is set/pinned to a specific spot on the 
                            page(screen), even after scrolling.</td>

                        <th>&lt;absolute&gt;</th>
                        <td>Absolute CSS Positioning</td>
                        <td>The &lt;absolute&gt; value for the CSS position property lets the element
                            ignore sibling elements and instead be positioned relative to its closest
                            parent element that is positioned with &lt;relative&gt; or &lt;absolute&gt;
                            &lt;absolute&gt; removes an element entirely from the document flow. 
                            The positioning attributes &lt;top&gt;, &lt;left&gt;, &lt;bottom&gt;, and 
                            &lt;right&gt;, allow the element to be positioned anywhere.

                    <tr>

                        <td>Relative CSS Positioning</td>
                        <td>This value of the CSS position property allows the element to be positioned
                            anywhere relative to its deafult position on the web page. The offset properties
                            can be used to set the actual position of the element, relative to the original.
                            Without offset properties, the positioning property would act as though it
                            has the default &lt;static&gt; property.

                        <td>This property determines how far left or right an element should float within
                            its parent element. The value &lt;left&gt; floats an element to the left side
                            of its container, and similarly for &lt;right&gt;. The width of the container
                            must be specified, else the element will assume the full wdith of its 
                            containing element.

                        <td>This property specifies how an element should behave when it bumps into
                            another element within the same containing element. This is ususally used
                            in combination with elements having the CSS &lt;float&gt; property. This 
                            determines on which sides floating elements are allowed to float.
